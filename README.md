# climate-app
The climate app is a basic React application that allows you to run the app without using the `create-react-app` command.
It provides a minimal setup by installing the necessary React and ReactDOM packages.
The app supports both JavaScript and TypeScript.

## How it works
### 1. Setup
    The app requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) to be installed on your machine.
    You can initialize a new project by creating a new directory and running `npm init` to generate a `package.json` file.
### 2. Dependencies
    Install the required dependencies by running the command `npm install react react-dom`.
    This will install React and ReactDOM packages in your project directory.
### 3. Entry Point
    Create an entry point file, such as `index.js` or `index.tsx`, depending on whether you're using JavaScript or TypeScript.
    This file will serve as the starting point of your application.
### 4. React Components
    Write React components in either JavaScript or TypeScript.
    You can create separate files for each component or organize them in a directory structure that suits your needs.
### 5. Rendering
    Import the necessary React and ReactDOM modules in your entry point file.
    Use the `ReactDOM.render` method to render your root component into the HTML DOM.
    For example, `ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))`.
### 6. JSX/TSX
    If you're using TypeScript, you can write JSX/TSX syntax to define your component's structure and behavior.
    JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript/TypeScript files.
### 7. Development Server
    To run your app, you need a development server.
    You can use a tool like `webpack-dev-server` or `parcel` to compile and serve your code.
    Set up the necessary configuration to bundle your JavaScript or TypeScript files and serve them to the browser.
### 8. Scripts
    Add the necessary scripts in your `package.json` file to facilitate running the app.
    For example, you can set up a `"start"` script to run your development server.
### 9. Running the App
    Execute the command `npm start` (or the appropriate script name) in your project directory.
    This will start the development server and launch your app in the browser.

With these steps, you should have a basic React app up and running. You can continue building your app by adding more components, implementing state management (e.g., Redux), incorporating styling (e.g., CSS modules), and integrating with APIs or backend services as needed.
